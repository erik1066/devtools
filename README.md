# DevTools Desktop App

A privacy-focused, Windows desktop app with tools to aid development workflows. No more Googling 'RGB to Hex' and finding every search result loads megabytes of advertisements, trackers, and other JavaScript nuisances. DevTools is a native, open source app that loads zero external content and never phones home.

Features:
* JsonPath tester
* Regular expression tester
* RGB to Hex converter
* Base64 encoder and decoder
* SHA-1 and SHA-2 (512) hasher

# DevTools

**A privacy-focused set of tools that provides commonly-needed features for software developers.**

Tired of searching for 'RGB to Hex', GUID generators, and other stuff you need in your day-to-day,
    only to find every result loads megabytes of advertisements, trackers, and other JavaScript nuisances?
    DevTools is a way to avoid that mess and get your work done with peace of mind. No spying, tracking, malvertisements,
    or other garbage. DevTools loads no external content and never phones home.

DevTools can run as a native Windows 10 application or as a web application. A feature comparison across platforms is shown below:

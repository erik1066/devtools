# DevTools

**A privacy-focused set of tools for software developers.**

Tired of searching for 'RGB to Hex', GUID generators, and other stuff you need in your day-to-day,
    only to find every result loads megabytes of advertisements, trackers, and other JavaScript nuisances?
    DevTools is a way to avoid that mess and get your work done with peace of mind. No spying, tracking, malvertisements,
    or other garbage. DevTools loads no external content and never phones home.
